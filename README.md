# Webpack lunch and learn repo

This repo is just a quick, definitively inexhaustive view of webpack.

The idea was to have a bunch of tagged commits that will make it easier to walk through some different examples without the need to write a ton of code in front of people. Each tag will build on the last and add more functionality.

### Tags

`0` - Zero configuration basic basic

`1` - Basic configuration to add `HtmlWebpackPlugin` and `CleanWebpackPlugin`, and a `--watch` npm script
